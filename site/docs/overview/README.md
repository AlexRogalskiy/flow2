# Flow documentation

Estuary Flow is a tool for building, testing, and evolving pipelines that continuously capture, transform, and materialize data across all of your systems. It unifies today's batch and stream processing models so that your systems – current and future – are synchronized around the same datasets, updating in milliseconds. Use Flow to:

 * Perform *change data capture* from MySQL tables into PostgreSQL or a cloud analytics warehouse
 * Fetch, transform, and load logs from cloud delivery networks (CDNs) into Elastic Search or BigQuery
 * Instrument real-time analytics over your business events, accessible from current tools like PostgreSQL or even Google Sheets
 * Capture and organize your data from your SaaS vendors (like Salesforce or Facebook), into a Parquet data lake

You work with Flow through its intuitive web application or using the command line interface.
The system is designed so that whole teams of data stakeholders can collaborate on the same data pipelines (called **data flows** in the Flow ecosystem).
Business users and analysts can configure data flows to connect disparate systems in minutes,
and engineers can then refine those pipelines, troubleshoot, and configure complex transformations in their preferred environment.

Under the hood, Flow comprises cloud-native streaming infrastructure, a powerful runtime for data processing,
and an open-source ecosystem of pluggable connectors for integrating your existing data systems.

### Quick start

**Want to get up and running ASAP?**

See the [get started documentation](../getting-started/installation.md),

**Wondering if Flow is right for you?**

If you're unsure if Flow is the right solution for your data integration needs, you can read about the technical benefits and clear comparisons with similar systems, from an engineering perspective.

* **[Who should use Flow?](overview/who-should-use-flow.md)**
* **[Comparisons with other systems](overview/comparisons.md)**

**Looking to understand the concepts behind Flow at a deeper level?**

We recommend starting with a tutorial or guide to get acquainted with basic Flow concepts in action.
After that, read the **[Concepts](concepts/README.md)** to go deeper.
